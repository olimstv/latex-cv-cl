A software developer with a background in automation testing. 

I genuinely believe that our World can become much better if every living being had the most positive life experience. I see tremendous opportunities to contribute to the improvement of people's life experiences by developing software solutions. Therefore I would love to join a team of like-minded people, where I can effectively grow and apply my professional and personal skills to benefit the community.
